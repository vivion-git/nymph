I'll to explain this right:
I'm in an environment where I can't use python built-in functions (like
'sorted', 'set'), can't declare methods, can't make conditions (if), and can't
make loops, except for:

    *

      can call methods (but just one each time, and saving returns on another
variable

      foo python:item.sort(); #foo variable takes the value that item.sort()
returns

      bar python:foo.index(x);
    *

      and can do list comprehension

      [item['bla'] for item in foo]

...what I don't think that will help on this question

I have a 'correct_order' list, with this values:

correct_order = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

about the pickle module:
pickle:convert the python object to the streams of bytes and back.
dump(obj, file[, protocol ])
    Write a pickled representation of obj to the open file object file. This
is equivalent to Pickler(file,
    protocol).dump(obj).
load(file)
    Read a string from the open file object file and interpret it as a pickle
data stream, reconstructing and
    returning the original object hierarchy. This is equivalent to
Unpickler(file).load()
% python
>>> import pickle
>>> mydb  = open('dbase', 'r')
>>> table = pickle.load(mydb)
>>> table
{'b': ['spam', 'eggs'], 'a': [1, 2, 3], 'c': {'name': 'bob'}}

% python
>>> import pickle
>>> f = open('temp', 'w')
>>> x = ['Hello', ('pickle', 'world')]           # list with nested tuple
>>> pickle.dump(x, f)
>>> f.close( )                                   # close to flush changes
>>>
>>> f = open('temp', 'r')
>>> y = pickle.load(f)
>>> y
['Hello', ('pickle', 'world')]
>>>
>>> x == y, x is y
(True, False)
