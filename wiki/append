note :about the function append and sort ,we should know that the two function
can change operation like the list.append and list.sort,do not return the
values.It's not uncommon for beginners to say something like
mylist=mylist.append(x)to try to get the result of an append,but what this
actually does is assign mylist to none,not to the modified list .

>>> list=[1,2,3]
>>> list.append(4)  #this statement can't be wrotten as "list=list.append(4)"
>>> print list
[1, 2, 3, 4]
sort is the same use to append ,like list.sort().
