*******************
I will extract the base knowleage and import use in function ,loop,module and
so on ,to write them in this file in order to emphasis them and remind me to
use them correctly in my programms.
**********************
1)module and function
a.use the function:len()to count the lines and characters in a file.
def countlines(filename):
    f=open(filename)
    return len(f.readlines())   #count the lines in a file

def countchars(filename):         #count the characters in a file
     f=open(filename)
     return len(f.read())

def test(filename):
    return countchars(filename)
#when we use the programm ,first ,we use it as a module,so we should import it
in the first ,and then we can use the attribute test to self-test .also ,we
can run it by invoking the function countlines() and countchars()

b.anther way to write a programm to count the lines and the characters ,using
for loop to complete it.

def countlines(filename):
    f=open(filename)
    count=0
    for line in f.readlines():
        count=count+1
    print count


def countchars (filename):
    count=0
    for word in open(filename).read():
        count +=1
    print count
countlines('add.py')
countchars('add.py') 

to compare the two programm ,we can see using module to complete the task is
very easy and fast.
